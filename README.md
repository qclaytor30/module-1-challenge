"On the job ticket challenge"

For this challenge I began with a starter code that needed some fixes and improvements (refactor the code). Mainly focusing on the accessibility of the website.

The client wanted a codebase that follows accessibility standards so that the site is optimized for search engines. 
Made sure the html elements are semantic and in logical structure, all image elements included alt attributes, and everything falls in sequential order.
